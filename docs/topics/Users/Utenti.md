Overview
--------


Access to PROINSPECT features is regulated by authorization levels. Each user is assigned a level that allows access to interface elements an features. Each user can define the application layout that will be retrieved when logged in.


There are 4 authorization levels. Here are listed levels from higher to lower:

| | | |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | Administrator | Reserved for system installer |
| 2 | Super | Assigned to the system manager |
| 3 | Leader | Assigned to privileged system operator |
| 4 | Operator | Assigned to the machine operator |


You can have any number of users with its authorization level.


The Administrator user has access to all PROINSPECT features and has the right to define access permissions for users of other levels.


PROINSPECT can only be closed by authorized users.


Forced user
-----------


When closing PROINSPECT the name of the current user is saved. When PROINSPECT restarts the saved current is logged in. If you want a specific user to be logged in when PROINSPECT starts you must enter a valid name in the registry variable ForcedUser.


It is possible to change the current user to the forced user after a time of user inactivity by setting the registry variable ForcedUserIdleTime.


User switching occurs automatically if the current user has an authorization level higher than ForcedUserConfirmationLevel. Otherwise a confirmation window appears
