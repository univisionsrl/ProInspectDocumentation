Basic tools
===========


The basic tools are used to construct the recipe and to define the processing flow.


The recipe consists primarily of views. Each view represents a specific acquisition system. All the tools within the view process the image coming from the corresponding system.


The tools can be grouped using the Group tool .


The positioning of the tools can be conditioned by the result of other tools using the Fixture tool.
