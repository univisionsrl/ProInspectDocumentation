TInspect
========

Overview
--------

The purpose of the Template Inspection tool is to detect defects on a surface. TInspect needs to be pre-aligned by other tools providing a Fixture that arranges its run time position. The tool creates the template model image of an object statistically, from a set of training images and then compares run-time images of the object with it. A defect is any region that differs from model more than an expected tolerated variation given by the training images set. A defect can be a dark or bright spot on an object, an incorrectly shaped feature, or the absence of a shape. Basically, TInspect preprocesses image, computes difference with threshold image, applies some morphology filtering, and runs blob analysis.

| Analysis | |
| --- | --- |
| Intensity sensitivity | This parameter represents an index of the sensitivity of the tool to variations of brightness. The higher the value the smaller will be the intensity difference considered as a defect. Intensity sensitivity modifies the threshold image used to filter runtime image. Its range varies from 0 (low sensitivity) to 99 (high sensitivity). Every value drives a pair of parameters (#Proportional and #Constant) that define how the threshold image is modified.  I(x, y) =Â Proportional \ SDev + Constant At every position (x, y) threshold image intensity I is the sum of a constant value and a scaling value of standard deviation of training samples at that point. (default = 25)<blockquote> **Proportional**<br>Scaling factor for the sensitivity function. (default = 8.0)<br>  **Constant**<br>Offset level for the sensitivity function. (default = 15.5)<br> </blockquote> |
| Dimension sensitivity | This parameter represents an index of the sensitivity of the tool to the area of defects. The higher the value the smaller will be the area of a region considered as a defect. Dimension sensitivity is the minimum area of blob analysis after thresholding. (default = 25)<blockquote> **Area min. (pixel)**<br>Minimum area that can be considered as a defect. (default = 75)<br> </blockquote> |
| Defect mode | | Dark and White objects (default) | Looks for defects with both polarities. It means that difference between run time image and threshold image is unsigned. | | --- | --- | | White objects (default) | Looks for defects with white polarity. Dark differences are clamped. | | Dark objects | Looks for defects with black polarity. White differences are clamped. | |
| Normalization | Normalization to apply to runtime image before preprocessing.<ud> <li>None<br>Normalization is not performed.</li>  <li>Mean & StDev<br>Normalization is applied by mean and standard deviation.</li>  <li>Mean<br>Normalization is applied by mean.</li> </ud> |
| Sobel image | Sobel Image used to highlight borders and edges of template image.   | None | Do not use | | --- | --- | | Add image to samples | Add this image to threhold image to make tools less sensitive in that regions (around borders or edges). |     | Magnitude scaling factor | Sobel parameter to magnify edges. | | --- | --- | | Magnitude threshold | Threshold for Sobel's edges. | |
| Blank scene | Enable or disable TInspect working mode. If enabled, no template model is required but a uniform image of blank scene gray value. (default = 25)<blockquote> **blank scene value**<br>Template image gray value. (default = 128)<br> </blockquote> |
| Erode difference image | Morfology to apply to difference image. (default = false)<blockquote> **Filter size**<br>Size of erosion operator. (default = 1)<br> </blockquote> |
| St.Dev threshold | Pixel in the intermediate threshold image with a gray value bigger than this threshold will be mapped to 255. (default = 180) |
| Use train image as sample | Includes the train image in the training images set. (default = No) |
| Use custom samples | Uses a different training images set instead of usual. All tools in a View that needs statistical training use the same set. If this flag is set the tool must be trained alone. default = No)<blockquote> **Samples folder**<br>Specifies the folder containing training specific images set to use.<br> </blockquote> |
