Geometry
========



Overview
--------


Geometry tools are container tools that calculate geometrical relations using points provided by contained tools. The main operation of Geometry Tools is to compute the best fitting of source points to get a desired shape and evaluating residual error for each point. Residual error is the offset between result point and corresponding ideal one on the fitted shape.


How it works
------------


Drag new tools or link existing ones into the desired Geometric container tool. Train all (container and contained) in order to get specification positions orientations and measurements. Run on valid images.
