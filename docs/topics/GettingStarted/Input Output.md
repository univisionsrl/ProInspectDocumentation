# Input Output

The Inputs/Outputs step is used to define the settings of the discrete
input and output lines and I/O modules. You can customize the signal
type, select the edge transition and tool results of the signal.

## Output results

The result of the inspection is typically a digital True/False signal
made available to an external line control or ejection device. Use the
Cycle window to set the digital output lines to be used and the timings
of the signals.
