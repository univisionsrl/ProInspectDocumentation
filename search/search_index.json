Asymbol using Code 39 symbology encodes each character using 5 bars and 4 spaces for a total of 9 elements, and 3 out of the 9 elements are always wide. The symbol can include a checksum character for error detection.</li> <li>UPC/EANUPC is a fixed-length, numeric-only symbology which can be scanned bidirectionally. The size for a UPC symbol can vary to accommodate various printing processes, but the code works best when the height of  the symbol exceeds its width. European companies use the generally equivalent European Article Numbering (EAN) system.</li> <li>Code 128Code 128 is a very high-density alphanumeric symbology which can be scanned bidirectionally. The symbology can encode the entire 128 ASCII character set plus four non-data characters. A symbol using Code 128 symbology encodes each character using 11 black or white modules, and each symbol includes a checksum character</li> <li>Interleaved 2 of 5Popular in warehouse applications, Interleaved 2 of 5 (also called I-2/5 or ITF) is a variable-length, numeric-only code. A symbol using Interleaved 2 of 5 symbology encodes 2 characters in a unit of 5 bars and spaces, where the even position character is encoded into bars while the odd position character is encoded into spaces. The Interleaved 2 of 5 symbology can only encode data with an even number length. The symbol can include a checksum character for error detection.</li> <li>4 State4-State is an alphanumeric symbology adopted by the Australian Post. A barcode using the 4-State symbology encodes each character using 4 different types of bars, each of which has a distinct name and value. A 4-State barcode can be generated in one of three different structures of 37 bars (standard), 52 bars, or 67 bars. The ID tool supports the Australian,  UPU, Japan Post and USPS versions of the 4-state symbology.</li> <li>POSTNETThe Postal Numeric Encoding Technique (POSTNET) barcode was nvented by the US Postal Office to encode ZIP Code information. A barcode using the POSTNET symbology encodes each numeric character using a combination of 5 bars, either short or long. A POSTNET barcode can contain a 5-digit ZIP Code, a 5-digit ZIP + 4 Code, or an 11-digit delivery point code. The symbol always includes a checksum character.</li> <li>RSSReduced Space Symbology (RSS) was developed as a family of seven linear symbologies to provide users with features that address specific space limitation and application needs. RSS is designed to allow encoding of up to 74 characters of data. RSS allows greater capacity for encoding and capturing data such as product supplier, expanded product identification, price per pound, extended price, product weight, and so on. The ID tool supports a variety of RSS types.</li> <li>Code 93Code 93 is an alphanumeric code similar to Code 39 and can encode 48 different characters. Code 93 is more compact than Code 39, but is not as widely used.</li> <li>CodabarDeveloped in the early 1970s, Codabar is designed to be accurately read even when printed on dot-matrix printers for multi-part forms such as FedEx Airbills and blood bank forms. Although newer symbologies hold more information in a smaller space, Codabar has a large installed base in libraries.</li> <li>PharmaCodeAlso known as Pharmaceutical Binary Code, Pharmacode is used in the pharmaceutical industry as a packing control system. It is designed to be readable despite printing errors.</li> <li>PDF417PDF417 is a stacked linear bar code symbol used in a variety of applications, including transport, identification cards, and inventory management.</li> Mirrored Flag indicates whether the image is mirrored.."},{"location":"topics/Tools_Reference/Vision_Tools/Identification/BarCode/#more","title":"More","text":"<p>Click here to access the More section description.</p>"},{"location":"topics/Tools_Reference/Vision_Tools/Identification/BarCode/#results","title":"Results","text":"Decision Pass/Fail decision of a tool.

In order to accommodate the wide variation in the appearances of characters in different applications, the OCR API is split into three separate vision tools:</p> <ul> <li>Character segmentation takes an image as input and produces a set of segmented character images.</li> <li>Classification takes the segmented character images and determines what character each corresponds to.</li> <li>Fielding takes the entire result string from the classifier and checks to see whether the string matches what the user expected as a good result.</li> </ul> <p>The OCR Tool tries to read a paragraph: a string or a set of strings containing characters using the same font. For each line the ROI (region of interest) has to be set. Increase parameter number of regions for several lines. The ROI is specified as an affine rectangle that specifies the approximate location, angle, and skew of the line of text. The ROI must be entirely contained within the input image. The x axis of the affine rectangle should be parallel to the baseline of the text, and the y axis should be parallel to the vertical strokes of the characters. The ROI is expected to contain only the one line of text to be read and some surrounding background and should be larger than the line of text by at least half a character width on all sides if possible.</p> <p>The OCR Classifier takes a rectified image of a character and returns the best matching character, the score of that best matching character, and the confidence of that best matching character. The OCR Classifier can be incrementally trained with additional training images at any time. The OCR Classifier determines not only the classification (character code/instance) of the run-time rectified image, but it also reports the score of that classification and the confidence of that classification. The score is an indication of the closeness of the match to the training instances. The confidence is computed as the difference between the score of the classification and the score of the next-highest classification.</p> <p>The OCR Dictionary Fielding tool provides functionality to verify and correct strings read by the OCR Classifier. There are two secondary usages:</p> <ul> <li>OCR result verification: in this usage, you try to determine whether the OCR result is correct or not by comparing it against acceptable results specified via fielding.</li> <li>OCR result correction: in this usage, the raw OCR result string is not among the acceptable results. The user tries to find an acceptable string allowed by the field that is closest to raw OCR result string. </li> </ul> <p>The OCR Dictionary Fielding tool also allows for the possibility of multiple candidates for each character in the input string.</p>"},{"location":"topics/Tools_Reference/Vision_Tools/OCR_and_OCV/OCR/#settings","title":"Settings","text":"Options Enable Enables or disables the tool.

(default = No) Max character height (pixel)Sets the maximum allowable height of a character\u2019s mark rectangle, in pixels. This value is used in two ways. First, this value is used when finding the line as a whole; for example, to reject vertically adjacent noise and/or other lines of vertically adjacent characters. Second, an individual character whose height exceeds this value will be trimmed to meet this height. Stage. (default = 100.0) Use min aspect Sets whether to use Min aspect to split wide characters.

(default = 360; min = 0; max = 360) Angle-Tolerance for negative angles. (default = 360; min = 0; max = 360) Coverage Enables or disables the coverage tolerance limit. The coverage score is a measure of the extent to which all parts of the trained pattern are also present in the run-time image. The coverage score is computed by determining the proportion of the trained pattern that is found in the run-time image. If all of the trained pattern is also present in the run-time image, the coverage score is 1.0. Lower coverage scores indicate that less of the pattern is present. Coverage limitMinimum acceptable value. (default = 1.0) Clutter Enables or disables the clutter tolerance limit. The clutter score is a measure of the extent to which the found object contains features that are not present in the trained pattern. The clutter score is the proportion of extraneous features present in the found object relative to the number of features in the trained pattern. A clutter score of 0.0 indicates that the found instance contains no extraneous features. A clutter score of 1.0 indicates that for every feature in the trained pattern there is an additional extraneous feature in the found pattern instance. The clutter score can exceed 1.0. Clutter limitMinimum acceptable value. (default = 0.0) Fit error Enables or disables the fit error tolerance limit. The fit error is a measure of the variance between the shape of the trained pattern and the shape of the pattern instance found in the run-time image. The fit error is computed by taking the square root of the sum of the weighted average distances between each boundary point in the pattern and the corresponding boundary point in the pattern instance in the run-time image. If the pattern instance in the run-time image is a perfect fit for the trained pattern, the fit error is 0.0.

(default = 0.50) Contrast threshold Minimum contrast of boundaries used to locate the pattern. (default = 10) Elasticity It specifies the degree to which you will allow PatMax to tolerate deformations of the object boundaries. You specify the elasticity value in pixels. You should keep the following points in mind when specifying a nonzero elasticity value: \u2022 Specifying a nonzero elasticity value does not affect PatMax\u2019s execution speed. \u2022 Increasing the elasticity value does not decrease PatMax\u2019s accuracy. However, location information returned about additional object instances that are found as a result of increasing the elasticity value can be less accurate. \u2022 If the elasticity value is too low, you will see low scores and your application may fail to find patterns in the run-time image and/or the positions will be incorrect or unstable. \u2022 If the elasticity value is too high, PatMax may match false instances and may return inaccurate or unstable results. (default = 0.00) Score using clutter When this option is enabled, the system takes into account the clutter (presence of extra contours in the image that were not present in the model) in computing the global score.

(default = No) MinLower limit in %. (default = 50) MaxUpper limit in %. (default = 200) Ignore polarity You can specify whether to ignore the polarity of contours. Each of the boundary points that describes a pattern feature has a polarity. The polarity of a boundary point indicates whether the boundary can be characterized as light-to-dark or dark-to-light. You can configure PatMax to find only objects in which every boundary point has the same polarity as the trained pattern, or you can configure PatMax to find objects with mismatched polarity. Pattern granularity PatMax uses large features first to do a pre-localization of the object and then refines the search using fine features. Granularity is expressed as the radius of interest, in pixels, within which features are detected. <li>Automatic (default)The system perform, at train time, an estimate of the optimal settings for Fine and Coarse granularity.</li> <li>ManualYou define fine and coarse granularity to use to train the pattern and to run.</li> FineThe smallest granularity used to detect features in the training image or shape description.

(default = 8) Algorithm Used algorithm. <li>PatMax (default)Full PatMax.</li> <li>PatQuickA quicker version of the PatMax algorithm. PatQuick provides the basic PatMax results but lacks separate measurements of clutter, coverage and fit error.

PatMax will run slower in high sensitivity mode than in standard sensitivity mode. (default = No) Sensitivity parameterWhen set to 1.0 PatMax uses minimum noise rejection. when set to 10.0 PatMax uses maximum noise rejection. Usually the default value 2.0 produces optimal results. This is an advanced parameter and should usually be left set to its default value. (default = 2; min = 0; max = 10) Manual edge threshold Enables or disables manual edge threshold. If set to true, tells PatMax to ignore the   automatic edge detection threshold computed at train time and  to use the user supplied edge threshold.  edge thresholdthreshold to use instead of automatically computed at train time. (default = 5) Deformation rate expected deformation rate in\u00a0PatFlex. Higher values increase the time of the alignment, and  may result in spurious matches due to the large amount  of freedom that the tool has to deform parts of the training image to fit the run-time image. Flex elasticity PatFlex flex pattern elasticity in pixels. (default = -1) Limited deformation whether or not deformation is known to be minor, in  PatFlex. If the runtime image is sufficiently undeformed  (e.g. undeformed enough that the PatMax algorithm can still  find it, even though PatMax's answer might not be completely  accurate), then setting this flag to true may result in  accurately modeled deformation at much higher speeds"},{"location":"topics/Tools_Reference/Vision_Tools/Pattern_Match/PatMax/#more","title":"More","text":"<p>Click here to access the More section description.</p>"},{"location":"topics/Tools_Reference/Vision_Tools/Pattern_Match/PatMax/#results","title":"Results","text":"Results Decision Pass/Fail decision of a tool, including multiple results if any.
